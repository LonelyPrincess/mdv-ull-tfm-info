# Land of the Forgotten

This repository contains information on a prototype developed with Unreal Engine 5, which may be expanded to form a full sized game later on. It was created for educational purposes as the final project for the [videogame development degree](https://www.ull.es/masteres/desarrollo-videojuegos/) in University of La Laguna.

**The aim of this project has been the development of a prototype for a videogame that, as part of its core mechanics, includes the usage of the japanese language.** Writing specific japanese characters will be required to interact with certain elements of the level and make progress in the game. In this way, the game intends to aid people interested in learning the language to memorize these symbols in a more enjoyable way.

The prototype was built using C++ classes together with Blueprints. Most logic for all the in-game actors or components are written in C++, whereas their Blueprint counterparts are used to easily customize the actor properties and assign a proper location for their subcomponents in the viewport.

## Game overview

### üìñ Synopsis

_"Land of the Forgotten"_ follows the adventures of Miko, a young priestess with supernatural powers who's able to see the ghosts of people who, for one reason or another, weren't able to pass on when they died and remain trapped between this realm and the other side. Those poor souls, lost and forgotten, are just awaiting for someone to call their name for the last time...

Miko has the ability to cast spells by writing in her magic cards, and she'll be able to use them to put these lost souls at ease and allow them to ascend to Heaven.

Taking upon the mission of saving those poor souls, Miko travels around the world to find and save as many as she can. Her loyal friend, Hinomaru, a small flame with a life of its own, will accompany her on this journey and help her to accomplish her mission.
